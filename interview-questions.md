# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:  Git free is a version control software created by Linus Torvalds, the man who created Linux, back in 2005. Git allows you to create local repositories on your machine to keep track of old and updated code. Github is further step to git and was created in 2008 as a way to create remote repositories as well for use with others in collaboration. These repositories are held on the Github server and can be pulled for local storage as needed through terminal commands.

Researched answer: Git is a free, open-source version control system widely used in the programming world. Git is a technology that is independent of any programming language or computer operating system.

Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, to track changes in source code. Git is accessed primarily through the command line.

GitHub is an online platform that uses git version control technology. GitHub allows developers to share and store code. GitHub is the largest host of code in the world (as of 2023). GitHub also offers developers tools for testing and deployment of applications. Developers create personal GitHub accounts that can be connected to teams allowing for collaboration on projects.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index is the location of each character within the square brackets. It's value is the individual items within those brackets.

Researched answer: Each item in the array is called an element. The content of each element is called the value. Every value in an array has a particular location known as the index.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings are the same in that they include a collection of values that can be accessed via index location. But different in what information they can hold. Strings are used to represent text and their values sit inside quotation marks, single or double. Arrays on the other hand can be used to represent a variety of different data types and are defined as having square brackets, with different values separated by commas. Strings values can not changed once created by an arrays values can be changed.

Researched answer: Arrays are variables that store collections of data in an ordered list. Arrays are indexed which means the data can be accessed by its location within the array. In JavaScript, arrays and strings have a lot of similar properties. They both are a collection of items, both have a length property, both are zero-indexed. But strings and arrays have many differences. It is often convenient to convert strings into arrays and vice-versa.


4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) uses Four pillars of OOPs to create efficient software systems: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. These four pillars provide the foundation for writing maintainable and scalable code.

Encapsulation is a way to keep code organized and separate from other codes in the system. It is done by using classes that contain all the code related to a specific feature or subject.
Abstraction is the process of hiding internal details or processes from the user. This is done by creating classes that represent real-world objects and their attributes.
Inheritance is when a class inherits the methods and properties of another class. This allows developers to reuse code and easily add new features.
Polymorphism allows developers to create multiple methods with the same name, but with different implementations. This makes it easier to create flexible systems that are easier to understand and maintain.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher-order function is a built in method in JavaScript that takes in a function as an argument. Often higher-order functions are designed to operate on arrays. The function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array. This makes higher-order functions incredible useful for iteration.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. Jest was created by Facebook and used by Twitter, Spotify, and Airbnb.

3. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.
